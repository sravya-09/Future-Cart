# FutureCart: AI-Driven Demand Prediction for Smarter Retail

## Project Overview
FutureCart is an AI-driven demand forecasting model designed to help e-commerce businesses optimize inventory management and improve marketing efficiency. Using time series analysis and multivariate regression, the project predicts future demand based on historical sales data and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Google clicks and Facebook impressions.

## Objectives
- Develop an accurate demand forecasting model for e-commerce platforms.
- Leverage time series analysis and multivariate regression techniques.
- Optimize inventory management and reduce stockouts or overstocking.
- Provide data-driven insights to improve marketing strategies.
- Create a scalable solution for handling large datasets across multiple products.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Collection
- Gather historical sales data and relevant KPIs (e.g., Google clicks, Facebook impressions).
- Preprocess the data for consistency and completeness.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform data visualization and statistical analysis.
- Identify trends, seasonality, and correlations among variables.

### 3. Time Series Modeling
- Train models such as **ARIMA, SARIMA, and SARIMAX** for forecasting.
- Evaluate performance based on accuracy metrics like RMSE and MAE.

### 4. Multivariate Regression
- Implement regression models incorporating external variables (clicks, impressions, etc.).
- Compare results with time series models to determine the best approach.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Selection
- Compare different models based on performance metrics.
- Optimize hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

### 6. Deployment and Documentation
- Present results with visualizations and reports.
- Document methodologies and findings for future improvements.
